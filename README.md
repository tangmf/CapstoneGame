# CapstoneGame

## Features still in development:
- Character selection: Currently, the other characters are just recolors of the same character, and the character select UI is not refined yet.
- Character upgrade: Currently, character upgrading works but is just a temporary solution that we will change when the other characters are implemented.
- Spawn animations / Death animations are still temporary

## Notes
- Coin system is already developed but just note that the add/remove coins buttons on the profile bar are temporary and just debug tools.
- To play a locked level, hover the start button at the bottom right corner. You should be able to access the button and play the level. This is intentional to make debugging / testing easier.
